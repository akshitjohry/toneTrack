# ToneTrack
ToneTrack is a streaming service that allows users to record a conversation through the ToneTrack URL. In real-time, the ToneTrack backend distinguishes different speakers in the conversation, detects the mood of each individual, and provides real-time emotion detection graphs as the conversation is going on.

Use cases:
With virtual meetings being an essential part of almost every industry now, we think ToneTrack is an invaluable asset in several practical applications. Some of them are identified as follows:
* Corporate Online Team meetings: Track employees' emotions over the course of the meeting.
* Therapist Sessions: Deliver valuable insights from client conversations and reshape the treatment
* Online Classes: Assess students' emotions and stress levels.
